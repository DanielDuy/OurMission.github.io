                    Do you ever see countries work together build each other up? You have probably seen countries help each other, but not in a big scale. You will mostly see countries just minding their own buisness. But what if we could give them each other attentions? Could it make a difference in the world by world cooperation? Would it bring both the world leaders and the population closer? Let's say, that we could start with something small, but something very effective. And with the little push, can it maybe make the world a better place?
